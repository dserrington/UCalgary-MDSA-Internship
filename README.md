# UCalgary Master of Data Science & Analytics Internship

## Professional Programs Research Proposal

### Project Overview

As someone who already has some experience with survey design and analysis, the purpose of this project will be to expand my knowledge in the area and acquire new skills/techniques specifically related to **structural equation modeling** (SEM). Although I have not choosen to focus specifically on Health Data Science or Biostatistics, I believe this project will still align with the broader content of my program, as it will involve the manipulation and analysis of large datasets using tools and techniques that I have previously developed in my graduate studies at the University of Calgary.

Generally speaking, the objectives of this project will be:

1. To understand/explore the importance of survey validation, questionnaire development, and analysis using SEM and other analytical survey techniques; and
2. Present my knowledge/findings in a meaningful and engaging way that is both educational and accessible to a wider audience.
